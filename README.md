# Climate change website
This is a website for learning some information about climate change, so that it’s more accesible.
It will contain:
  1. A `.html` file containing the website
  2. A `.css` file containing the website’s styling

> Made for a custom [kodland](https://kodland.org) [hackathon](https://w.wiki/CKZJ) which has the topic of “climate change”
