    <h1>Climate change: Its Effects and How We Can Fix It</h1>
    <!---The first paragraphs--->
    <p>In the world that we live in, there are a ton of big problems, many moral, many that affect us, but there is one we really need to be careful of: <b>Climate Change</b></p>
    <p>Pretty much everyone has heard of climate change; there are always many news or articles that always say:</p>
    <blockquote>“Climate change is the reason for this forest fire!”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Nuclear plants contribute to climate change.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Climate change has caused these glaciers to start melting.”</blockquote>
    <p>And I’m not going to lie to you, <b>all of these claims are mostly true</b>.</p>
