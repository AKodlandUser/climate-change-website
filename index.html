    <h1>Climate change: Its Effects and How We Can Fix It</h1>
    <!---The first paragraphs (and blockquotes)--->
    <p>In the world that we live in, there are a ton of big problems, many moral, many that affect us, but there is one we really need to be careful of: <strong>climate change</strong></p>
    <p>Pretty much everyone has heard of climate change; there are always many news or articles that always say:</p>
    <blockquote>“Climate change is the reason for this forest fire!”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Nuclear plants contribute to climate change.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“Climate change has caused these glaciers to start melting.”</blockquote>
    <p>And I’m not going to lie to you, <b>all of these claims are mostly true</b>.</p>
    <h2>First of all, what exactly is climate change?</h2>
    <p><strong>Climate change</strong> are <b>long-term shifts</b> in weather and temperature. Ever since the 1800s, humans have been the main cause for climate change. This is mainly due to the <b>burning of fossil fuels</b> such as <b>coal</b>, <b>gas</b> and <b>oil</b>. Another cause of <strong>climate change</strong> is agriculture.<p>
    <p>These practices release gasses like <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> (CO₂) and <strong>methane</strong> (CH₄), which are <strong>greenhouse effect gasses</strong>, and when they reach the Earth’s atmosphere <b>they trap the sun’s heat in the atmosphere for longer than it’s supposed to.</b> This makes the Earth hotter, making many problems arrive.</p>
    <p>Here’s a list of things that <strong>Climate Change</strong> does to our planet.</p>
    <!---The effects--->
    <h2>Climate change’s effects</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Rise of temperatures</li>
      <p>Due to the trapping of <strong>greenhouse effect gasses</strong> in the Earth’s atmosphere, temperatures have been in <b>an all-time rise</b>. This creates problems such as the loss of different species’ habitats, which make many more animals be endangered, and intense droughts that damage many populations.</p>
      <li>Rise of sea level</li>
      <p>The <strong>rise of sea level</strong> is caused by <b>the melting of glaciers</b>. When they melt, their ice (now transformed into water) merges into the ocean, and with the high quantity of melting that happens, <b>sea level rises</b>. This can make floods and big storms occur.</p>
